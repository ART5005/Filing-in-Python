# Filing-in-Python
Create a dictionary with the following key-value pairs. (a and A both map to @)
Character Replacements:
a, A - @
e - 3
i - 1
o - 0 (i.e. a zero)
u - v
c - (
s - $

Your program should then read each line in the input file (input.txt), replace the characters as shown
(using the dictionary you created), and write the modified Words to another file (OutReplace.txt). 
Input.txt contents:
Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there’s no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle’s crumbled
And you’re left with just a name
Where’s your crown, King Nothing?

So, your OutReplace.txt file should look like:
th3n 1t @ll (r@$h3$ d0wn
@nd y0v br3@k y0vr (r0wn
@nd y0v p01nt y0vr f1ng3r
